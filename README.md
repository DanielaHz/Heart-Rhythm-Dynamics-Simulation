# Real-Time Soft Body Simulations with OpenGL

![image](/images/SimulationVideo-SoftBodyAproach.gif)

This project initially aims to simulate the dynamics of a human heart using the three-coupled oscillator model presented in the original paper. Since the heart is a soft body, I chose to use the Jelly Engine as the foundation for this assessment. However, given the limited time available for development and the complexity of implementing Jelly Engine, I realized it would not be feasible to simulate a human heart directly within this timeframe.

As a result, I decided to focus on improving soft body generation by processing a tetrahedral mesh. This method reads mesh data to generate a volumetric representation, enabling more efficient rendering and preserving the behavior of a soft body’s surface in a realistic way.

## Current Approach 

Soft body meshes are typically represented as systems of mass points connected by springs. Originally, Jelly Engine generated springs exponentially relative to the number of mesh vertices by connecting each point to others within a certain distance. Although inefficient, this approach worked for simple models because it created an apparent volume from the mesh surface, causing the structure to behave elastically and maintain its shape—even though .obj files only contain surface information.

The problem with this method is that it does not scale well with higher-resolution meshes. As mesh complexity increases, real-time simulations become unstable and often crash. To address this, I sought to improve volume generation by applying tetrahedralization—a common technique in real-time soft body simulation—to create an internal volumetric structure that is both more stable and computationally efficient.

Thus, the current simulation approach focuses on supporting more complex meshes through the use of tetrahedral meshes. These define a true volumetric structure suitable for physical simulation. This volumetric representation can then be processed within Jelly Engine to generate the soft body dynamics necessary for realistic modeling.

## Three-Coupled Oscillator Model

![img](/images/humanheart.png)

The normal cardiac rhythm is primarily generated by the SA node, the heart’s natural pacemaker, although the AV node also functions as a secondary pacemaker. Each produces an activation potential that contributes to the heart’s dynamics, though not all are equally reflected in the ECG signal. Activation waves from different regions (atria and ventricles) produce electrical currents of varying magnitudes, and their combination shapes the ECG signal.

Initially, two coupled oscillators are used to represent the SA and AV nodes. However, this is insufficient to fully reproduce the ECG, particularly the QRS complex, which corresponds to ventricular repolarization.

To address this, a third oscillator is introduced to represent the His–Purkinje system, responsible for conducting the pulse through the ventricles. The full conceptual model includes asymmetric bidirectional coupling between all oscillators, along with external periodic excitations, forming a system represented by differential equations.

| Name | Color Name | RGB Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SA Node | Blue | (1.000, 0.401, 0.839) |
| AV Node | Purple | (0.602, 0.253, 1.000) |
| HPC | Pink | (0.270, 0.604, 1.000) |

### Data to simulate
In the thesis titled "Las matemáticas de la fisiología del corazón", the authors simulate a human heart electrocardiogram and use that data for their analysis. I will use the same approach to achieve the best possible results.

| SA Node | AV Node | HCP Node |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sa.a = 3 | av.a = 3 | hcp.a = 5 |
| sa.w1 = 0.2 | av.w1 = 0.1 | hcp.w1 = 1 |
| sa.w2 = -1.9 | av.w2 = -0.1 | hcp.w2 = -1 |
| sa.d = 3 | av.d = 3 | hcp.d = 3 |
| sa.e = 4.9 | av.e = 3 | hcp.e = 7 |
| sa.omega = 0 | av.omega = 0 | hcp.omega = 0 |
| sa.q  = 1 | av.q = 1| hcp.q = 20 |
| sa.kSA_to_kAV = 0  | av.kAV_to_kSA = 5 | hcp.kHPC_to_kSA = 0 |
| sa.kSA_to_kHPC  = 0 | av.kAV_to_kHPC = 0 | hcp.kHPC_to_kAV = 20 |
| a0  = 1 | a1 = 0.1| a3 = 0.05 |
| a5 = 0.4 |  |  |
