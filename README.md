# Heart Rhythm Dynamics Simulation Using a Three-Coupled Oscillator Model

![img](/images/humanheart.png)

The present project aims to simulate the dynamics of a human heart using the three-coupled oscillator model proposed in the paper of the same name. Since the heart is a soft body, I will use the JellyEngine as the boilerplate for this assessment.

## Execution 

Build the project
```
mkdir build 
cd build 
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -B out .
```

Execute the project
```
cd ..
cmake --build

cd build/Game
./Game
```
## Three-Coupled Oscillator Model

The normal cardiac rhythm is primarily generated by the SA node, the heart’s natural pacemaker, although the AV node also functions as a secondary pacemaker. Each produces an activation potential that contributes to the heart’s dynamics, though not all are equally reflected in the ECG signal. Activation waves from different regions (atria and ventricles) produce electrical currents of varying magnitudes, and their combination shapes the ECG signal.

Initially, two coupled oscillators are used to represent the SA and AV nodes. However, this is insufficient to fully reproduce the ECG, particularly the QRS complex, which corresponds to ventricular repolarization.

To address this, a third oscillator is introduced to represent the His–Purkinje system, responsible for conducting the pulse through the ventricles. The full conceptual model includes asymmetric bidirectional coupling between all oscillators, along with external periodic excitations, forming a system represented by differential equations.
